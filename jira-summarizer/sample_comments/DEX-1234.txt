description: "
When there are lot of comments in a Jira story/task, one needs to go through all the comments to understand the status of the jira.
Develop a LLM based application which will take Jira number as user input and reads all the comments and provide quick summary on the status of the jira.
Teams:
1) Ashoka Bedre Krishnamurthy
2) Avanish V Patil
